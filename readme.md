# Pridemod
Pridemod is a work in progress mod for Minecraft: Java Edition made by Pridecraft Studios.
## What's in it?
Currently, nothing, but we plan to add everything from PridePack, as their own things to go *with* the vanilla game instead of replacing them, along wtih a few exclusive features.
## How do I get it?
You either compile it from source, like you would compile any other Fabric/Quilt mod, or you check on the releases tab for pre-releases.
## When are you making this?
Sometime between ``December 31, 1969 9:00 PM`` and ``November 16, 5138 6:46 AM``
